        <h2>JumpStart Day 1</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            In our first day at JumpStart we played some icebreakers to get to
            know our classmates better and also did our machine set up as well
            as learned the basic commands to use our command line effectively.

        <div>
          <p>
            Our second day covered more ground as we learned how to use the VS
            Code editor and the important Git tool for version control. We also
            gone through HTML and the basics of CSS.

            Day 3 was CSS day as we learned CSS in depth, understanding more
            about using relative units for responsive scaling as well us
            important layouts like grid and flexbox.

        <h2>JumpStart Day 4</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            This was mindblown day as we found out that when it comes to
            JavaScript, the more we know the more we realise we don't know! We
            learned the background of JavaScript, installing NodeJS, npm as well
            as basic JavaScript stuff such as assertions, variables, conditional
            statements and functions.

          <p>
            We dived deeper into the language that was only built in 10 days,
            learning about constructors, the <strong>this</strong> word and also
            callbacks.
