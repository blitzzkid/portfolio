          <p>
            Hi there! I'm Melvin and I have recently graduated from the
            JumpStart course at ThoughtWorks Singapore. The course teaches us
            JavaScript and its frameworks such as ReactJs, NodeJs and ExpressJs.
            More importantly, we are inculcated with agile practices including
            test driven development and pair programming
          </p>
          <p>
            Previously I was an Account Manager at Creitive Digital Agency where
            I was managing several projects on web and mobile applications. I
            also got to work on SEO projects as well as facilitate design
            thinking workshops with corporate clients.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thereafter I worked as a Research Assistant at the Singapore
            University of Technology and Design where I had to develop product
            requirements and design the Future Mobility Sensing web and mobile
            applications used for transportation research in Singapore.

          <p>
            In my free time I play the violin, work out at the gym and watch
            stand up comedies in town.

              As there is nothing more persuasive about the wonders of compound
              interest than a visual of an exponential chart, I decided to
              develop a retirement planner that displays your savings with and
              without investing at a set rate of return on investments. It also
              displays mutual funds which 5 year annualized returns exceed your
              chosen rate of returns.
            </p>
            <p>
              Achieved a unit/integration test coverage of 94% for backend with
              automated testing with Jest and React Testing Library. End to end
              automated testing was written with Cypress.
            </p>
            <p>
              Front end was developed with React and the backend was developed
              with NodeJs, ExpressJs and MongoDB

            <h3>Team project</h3>
            <p>
              As the HR team in ThoughtWorks used Excel to keep track of
              overseas ThoughtWorkers on secondment in Singapore and Thailand
              offices, we were tasked to continue on a legacy codebase to
              develop an internal tool that the HR and finance team could use to
              improve their productivity.
            </p>
            <p>
              I worked in a team of 6 with a daily rotation of pairing partners.
              I worked across various roles such as developer, Business Analyst
              and Quality Analyst.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a developer I worked in a pair to deliver user stories with
              test driven development. As a Business Analyst I prepared User
              Stories and its Acceptance Criteria, presenting the features
              implemented at end of each Sprint with a showcase with the Product
              Owner from HR. As a Quality Analyst I checked the quality of the
              unit, integration and end to end tests.

            <h3>Android App</h3>
            <p>
              During my own time I learnt Java and applied what I have learnt by
              building a simple android app, learning XML in the process. I also
              had to learn how to effectively use Android Studio and the Gradle
              Build Tool to ensure that my app can run on an android phone.
            </p>
            <p>
              This multiscreen app uses View Pagers to allow users to navigate
              through different screens on the app and view information about
              tourist locations relating to the history, culture, cuisine and
              events in Singapore.
