          <p>
            Hi there! I'm Melvin and I'm currently a JumpStart trainee at
            ThoughtWorks Singapore. The course teaches us JavaScript and its
            frameworks such as ReactJs, NodeJs and ExpressJs. More importantly,
            we are inculcated with agile practices including test driven
            development and pair programming
          </p>
          <p>
            Previously I was an Account Manager at Creitive Digital Agency where
            I was managing several projects on web and mobile applications. I
            also got to work on SEO projects as well as facilitate design
            thinking workshops with corporate clients.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thereafter I worked as a Research Assistant at the Singapore
            University of Technology and Design where I had to develop product
            requirements and design the Future Mobility Sensing web and mobile
            applications used for transportation research in Singapore.

          <p>
            I want to have a broad based understanding and skillset of
            technology, aspiring to be a fullstack developer after graduating
            from JumpStart.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time I play the violin, work out at the gym and watch
            stand up comedies in town.

            <p>
              As part of our JumpStart program, we worked on developing a
              personal website. It allows us to apply what we have learnt in the
              HTML and CSS lessons in our first week on the course.
            </p>
            <p>
              This website is also meant to showcase the skills we have acquired
              throughout our course at JumpStart, the projects we have worked
              on. Our professional resume and blogs our our learning journey is
              also featured.
            </p>

            <h3>Android App</h3>
            <p>
              During my own time I learnt Java and applied what I have learnt by building a simple android app, learning XML in the process. I also had to learn how to effectively use Android Studio and the Gradle Build Tool to ensure that my app can run on an android phone.
            </p>
            <p>
              This multiscreen app uses View Pagers to allow users to navigate through different screens on the app and view information about tourist locations relating to the history, culture, cuisine and events in Singapore.
