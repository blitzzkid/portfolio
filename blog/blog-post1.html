          JumpStart Day 1
        </h1>
        <p>
          In our first day at JumpStart we played some icebreakers to get to
          know our classmates better and also did our machine set up as well as
          learned the basic commands to use our command line effectively.

          I learned that even for Unix based operating systems, there is the BDU
          version which Mac is using and also the GNU version. Though it's day
          one we were already informed to prepare content for our first mini
          project which is this static website built from HTML and CSS that you
          are reading from right now.
