          <h1>
              JumpStart Day 5
          </h1>
          <p>
              We dived deeper into the language that was only built in 10 days, learning about constructors, the this word and also callbacks.
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Array.prototype or Object.prototype adds the function to the parent</li>
              <li>Object.prototype is the parent of Array.prototype</li>
              <li>setTimeout</li>
              <li>This refers to an object, it can be a global object or an instance object</li>
              <li>NodeJs has global objects</li>
              <li>Argument is the data you pass in, parameter is part of the function definition</li>
              <li>
                  Bind, Call, apply
                      - Arrow functions are equivalent to adding a .bind(this) to older function wait()
                      - For arrow functions, we cannot override the bind
                    </li>
              <li>
                      Scope
                      - Let and const are scoped to both function and block, cannot leak out of both function and block but can accept things inside
                      - Var is scoped to the function, cannot leak out of a function, but can leak out of block scope | can accept things inside
                      - Curly braces {} is a block scope
                      - Function scope is the => {} , the entire page is also a function
                    </li>
              <li>
                      Closure 
                      - the concept of an inner function remembering the info/data from the outer function so that it can also be used in the inner function
                      - add(1)(2)(3), argument on the rightmost is the first invocation
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
