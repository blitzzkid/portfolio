          JumpStart Day 2
        </h1>
        <p>
          In our first day at JumpStart we played some icebreakers to get to
          know our classmates better and also did our machine set up as well as
          learned the basic commands to use our command line effectively.

          Git: Less file.txt | grep - This does not work - Less does not give an
          output like cat does. Less takes the file and displays you a section
          of the file.

          HTML: Use tags that has semantic meaning - e.g. use &ltsection&gt or
          &ltarticle&gt instead of just &ltdiv&gt where appropriate,
          &ltstrong&gt instead of &ltb&gt and &ltem&gt instead of &lti&gt
